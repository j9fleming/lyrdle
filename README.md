1) Lyrdle
2) This game was inspired by Wordle and a music-inspired version of Wordle called Heardle. Instead of
 having players guess a song from snippets, they receive lyrics line by line and can directly compete
 against friends to be the first one to guess the correct song. It is additionally customizable because
 the players are prompted to enter an artist from which they want the song to be by. If two or more 
 players guess the song in the same number of attempts, whoever guessed it in a shorter amount of time
 wins. 
3) Janine Fleming, Matan Abrams, Isabel Berny
